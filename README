What is xlog
===================

xlog is a high efficent, thread safe, flexsible, pure c logging library. 

Actually, in the c world there is NO good logging library for application
like logback in java or log4cxx in c++.  printf can work, but can not be
easily redirected or reformat, syslog is slow and designed for kenerl use.

So I write xlog.


Install
===================

If checking out from Git (https://github.com/HardySimpson/xlog):

    $ sh autogen.sh

Then 

    $ ./configure --prefix=[where u wanna install it] --enable-test[compile test program]
    $ make
    $ make install

If --enable-test is used, then run all the test program under
test directory and see output. They are also good example codes
which show how to use xlog

Linking to xlog
===================

If your system has pkgconfig then you can just add this to your makefile

CFLAGS += $(shell pkg-config --cflags xlog)
LDFLAGS += $(shell pkg-config --libs xlog)

USE
===================
